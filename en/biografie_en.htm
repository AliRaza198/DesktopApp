        <p><img src="../images/stefanschramm.jpg" alt="NO COVER" width="130" height="152" class="cover" /><span class="content">Stefan Schramm was born in 1959 in Hamburg, Germany, and emigrated to Canada in 1981. Growing up in a family of artists, he explored various musical instruments, before deciding to focus on piano/keyboards and guitar. His studies led to a Bachelor of Music degree in Composition and Theory from the University of Victoria, B.C., and to a Master of Fine Arts degree in Electronic Music and Recording Media from Mills College, California. His influences range from the old masters to the latest popular artists; but he really loves just about anything that makes sounds and noises.<br />
        <br />
    Since the 1980's, he has been building his own recording facility. Over the years, this has turned into a production facility where dozens of albums, films and TV shows, a number of multimedia projects and interactive sound installations, soundtracks for computer games, and countless radio jingles have been produced. Most albums have received world-wide distribution and several have topped multiple gold and platinum status in Canada. In 1996, he was nominated for a Juno (Canadian Grammy) award as 'Instrumental Artist of the Year'. </span></p>
